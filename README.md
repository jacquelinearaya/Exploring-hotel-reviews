# Exploring Hotel reviews

This repository contains all data and scripts of my project, Exploring Hotel Reviews. You can read more about it [here](https://jacquelinearaya.github.io/2019/05/25/web_report.html).


Under the folder **data** you can find the scraped raw data from reviews (json files), as well as the tidy data (csv files) used for the statistical analysis, along with the correspondent python scripts.
